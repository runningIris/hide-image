# Hide Image

It is a deciphering game for programmers.

When we saw a photo that is kind of blur or weird, there is a chance that it mayhave a photo hidden behind it.

- `hide-image.py` is used to merge a photo `to_hide.jpeg` into `original.jpeg`.
- `reveal-image.py` is used to restore the message behind the result image.
